In computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing, Wikipedia has seen widespread use as a corpus for linguistic research. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification",[343] and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation.[344] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.[345]
