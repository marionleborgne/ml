"""Build a language detector model

The goal of this exercise is to train a linear classifier on text features
that represent sequences of up to N consecutive characters so as to be
recognize natural languages by using the frequencies of short character
sequences as 'fingerprints'.

The script saves the trained model to disk for later use

# TASK: Split the dataset in training and test set
# (use 20% of the data for test):


# TASK: Build a an vectorizer that splits strings into sequence of 1 to 3
# characters instead of word tokens using the class TfidfVectorizer


# TASK: Use the function make_pipeline to build a
#       vectorizer / classifier pipeline using the previous analyzer
#       and a classifier of choice.
#       The pipeline instance should be stored in a variable named model


# TASK: Fit the pipeline on the training set


# TASK: Predict the outcome on the testing set.
# Store the result in a variable named y_predicted


# TASK: Print the classification report


# TASK: Print the confusion matrix


# TASK: Is the score good? Can you improve it changing
#       the parameters or the classifier?
#       Try using cross validation and grid search

# TASK: Use dill and gz to persist the trained model in memory.
#       1) gzip.open a file called my_model.dill.gz
#       2) dump to the file both your trained classifier
#          and the target_names of the dataset (for later use)
#    They should be passed as a list [clf, dataset.target_names]
